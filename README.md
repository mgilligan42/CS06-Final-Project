# CS06-Final-Project
My final project for CS206: Client Side Web Development

The project was to create a website with an announcement board containing at least 3 categories that an admin could log into and edit the announcements on the front end of the site. Only the home/announcements pages was required for the project. All changes to the site would be front end only, so no changes would be saved to the back end. The site needed to read in the announcements from a XML file using AJAX, and the admin login information was to be stored in a JSON file. 

I based my fictional website off of Harry Potter, and made an announcements page for a fictional Hogwarts website, the different categories being the different Hogwarts Houses.
